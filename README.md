## Basic Github Usage

This is a repository. The repository is like a google drive folder; it contains all the folders, files, images, videos, etc that your project uses. This is the README file, which contains basic information about the project as well as basic instructions on how the project works. 

**Branching** is the main feature of Github that allows users to work on different versions of the project at the same time.
By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.

When you create a branch off the `master` branch, youâ€™re making a copy of `master` as it was at that point in time. 

## Create a new branch:
1. In the upper righthand corner, find the drop-down menu at the top of the file list that says ##branch-master##.
